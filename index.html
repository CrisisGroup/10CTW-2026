                the region's complex history. Eritrea and Ethiopia fought a brutal border war that killed tens of

            <h2>Gaza</h2>
            <p>
                The ceasefire is extremely fragile with frequent violations, and Israel's military chief has already
                declared the yellow line a "new border" while Israeli forces dig in with fortifications. The year ahead
                will likely see continued Israeli control over much of Gaza, with little prospect of the planned
                withdrawals or international stabilization force materializing.

            <p>
                Ukraine negotiations remain deadlocked over territory and NATO membership, with 2026 likely bringing
                either a frozen conflict requiring permanent European military presence or a controversial deal that
                rewards Russian aggression. Either outcome forces Europe to dramatically increase defense spending,
                manage long-term instability on its eastern border, and confront whether collective security guarantees
                still hold meaning in the post-American order.
